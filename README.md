# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on various diagnostic measurements included in the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The project utilizes machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. It contains the following features:

- **Pregnancies:** Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose:** Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure:** Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness:** Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin:** 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI:** Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Diabetes pedigree function
- **Age:** Age (years)
- **Outcome:** Class variable (0 or 1) indicating the presence or absence of diabetes

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The project begins by loading the dataset using pandas and performing initial exploratory data analysis. This involves checking the shape of the DataFrame, examining data types, identifying missing values, and generating descriptive statistics.

2. **Data Visualization:** Histograms and box plots are used to visualize the distribution of numerical features, allowing for the identification of patterns, skewness, multimodality, and potential outliers. A correlation matrix heatmap is also generated to explore relationships between features.

3. **Target Variable Analysis:** The distribution of the target variable 'Outcome' is analyzed using value counts and a bar chart. Relationships between numerical features and the target variable are visualized using box plots, violin plots, histograms, and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn (for potential model building)

## Usage
